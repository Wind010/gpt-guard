    <h1>Important Security Notice: Protect Your Sensitive Information when using text prompts.</h1>
    <p>Dear User,</p>
    <p>We want to bring your attention to the potential risks associated with disclosing sensitive information while interacting with AI-powered platforms like GPT, ChatGPT, and other similar sites. While these platforms strive to provide helpful and accurate responses, it is crucial to exercise caution when sharing personal, confidential, or sensitive information.</p>
    <p>Here are a few key points to keep in mind to ensure the security of your data:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Avoid sharing personal information</strong>: Refrain from providing details such as your full name, address, phone number, social security number, or any other personally identifiable information that could compromise your privacy.</li>
      <li><strong>Protect financial information</strong>: Never share your bank account details, credit card numbers, or any other financial information. Genuine organizations will never request this information via AI platforms.</li>
      <li><strong>Be cautious with passwords</strong>: Never disclose your passwords, login credentials, or other authentication information. Remember that responsible organizations will not ask for this information through AI platforms.</li>
      <li><strong>Exercise discretion with health data</strong>: Avoid sharing sensitive health information, including medical conditions, treatments, or medication details. Consult with healthcare professionals for accurate and secure medical advice.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay vigilant against phishing attempts</strong>: Be cautious of malicious actors who may impersonate AI platforms to trick users into divulging sensitive information. Always verify the authenticity of the website or platform you are interacting with.</li>
      <li><strong>Consider the public nature of conversations</strong>: Keep in mind that AI platforms may generate responses that are publicly visible. Avoid discussing confidential matters or engaging in sensitive conversations that you wouldn't want to be publicly accessible.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Remember, while AI platforms aim to improve user experiences, they are not infallible. Exercise caution and adhere to best practices for sharing information online. If you suspect any fraudulent activity or encounter suspicious behavior, please report it immediately to the respective platform administrators.</p>
    <p>Your data privacy and security are of utmost importance to us. By staying vigilant and mindful of potential risks, you can help protect yourself and maintain a safe online experience.</p>
    <p>Stay safe and secure!</p>
    <p>Best regards,<br>Your Friendly Neighborhood Whitehat - Wind010</p>
